# Weather Data API Endpoint â€“ Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

As a user, I want to retrieve current weather data for a specific city and state via a RESTful API endpoint, so that I can display up-to-date weather information in my application.

---

## User Stories

### 1. As an API consumer, I want to request weather data by providing a city and state, so that I can get the current weather for a specific location.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The endpoint accepts `city` and `state` as query parameters.
  - If either parameter is missing or invalid, the API returns a clear error message and appropriate status code.

### 2. As an API consumer, I want the API to return current weather details (temperature, humidity, conditions, etc.) in a standard JSON format.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The response includes temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
  - The response is well-structured and uses JSON.
  - The API returns HTTP 200 for successful requests.

### 3. As an API consumer, I want to receive meaningful error messages if I provide invalid input or if weather data is unavailable.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The API returns HTTP 400 for invalid or missing parameters.
  - The API returns HTTP 404 if weather data for the specified location is not found.
  - The API returns HTTP 500 for unexpected server errors.

### 4. As a developer, I want the endpoint to follow RESTful conventions and be well-documented.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The endpoint path is `/weather?city={city}&state={state}`.
  - The API is documented in OpenAPI/Swagger with request/response examples and status codes.

### 5. As a developer, I want the weather data retrieval logic to be abstracted behind an interface, so that it can be easily tested and maintained.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - There is a clear interface for the weather service.
  - External dependencies (e.g., third-party APIs) are abstracted and can be mocked in tests.

### 6. As a developer, I want robust input validation and error handling, so that the API is secure and reliable.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - All inputs are validated and sanitized.
  - Error responses do not leak sensitive information.
  - Errors are logged appropriately.

### 7. As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for the endpoint, service logic, and error handling.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Unit tests cover input validation, service logic, and error scenarios.
  - Integration tests cover the full request/response cycle.
  - External API calls are mocked in tests.

### 8. As an operator, I want the endpoint to be included in deployment and monitored for failures or high error rates.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The endpoint is part of deployment scripts.
  - Monitoring and alerting are set up for failures and high error rates.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Follows SOLID, Clean Code, DRY, and Pragmatic Programmer principles.
- Input validation and error handling are consistent and reusable.
- Performance is optimized (consider caching if appropriate).
- Security best practices are followed (input sanitization, no sensitive data in errors).
- The codebase is well-documented and maintainable.
