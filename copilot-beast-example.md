# Copilot Beast Example Conversation

## User Request: Implementation Plan for New Endpoint (in Ask Mode)

**Prompt:**
Let's create a new endpoint in our ASP.NET Core application that retrieves the weather for a specific city in a state. This will involve creating a new controller action that accepts parameters for the city and state, and returns weather data.

We'll also want to follow existing coding standards and ensure that the endpoint is tested.

Upon completion of this plan, output the plan in markdown format, including a todo list that outlines the steps to implement the new endpoint. The todo list should be clear and concise, allowing for easy tracking of progress.

## Copilot Response: Implementation Plan

Here’s a plan to add a new endpoint to your ASP.NET Core application that retrieves weather for a specific city in a state, following your standards and ensuring test coverage.

---

### Plan

1. **Design the Endpoint**
   - Create a new GET endpoint (e.g., `/weatherforecast/{state}/{city}`) that accepts `state` and `city` as route parameters.
2. **Implement the Logic**
   - Add logic to generate or retrieve weather data for the specified city and state.
   - Reuse or extend the existing [`WeatherForecast`](PromptingForImpactDemo.Api/Program.cs ) record as needed.
3. **Follow Coding Standards**
   - Ensure code style, naming, and structure are consistent with the rest of the project.
4. **Add Unit/Integration Tests**
   - Write tests to verify the new endpoint’s behavior.
5. **Document the Endpoint**
   - Update OpenAPI/Swagger documentation if applicable.

---

### Todo List

- [ ] Design the new endpoint route and parameters.
- [ ] Implement the endpoint logic in the API.
- [ ] Update or extend the [`WeatherForecast`](PromptingForImpactDemo.Api/Program.cs ) record if needed.
- [ ] Write unit/integration tests for the new endpoint.
- [ ] Update OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
- [ ] Review and refactor for coding standards.

## Feature: Weather by City and State Endpoint

### Overview
Add a new endpoint to the ASP.NET Core API to retrieve weather data for a specific city in a state. The endpoint will accept `state` and `city` as parameters and return weather information, following existing coding standards and ensuring test coverage.
