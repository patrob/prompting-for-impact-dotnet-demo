Let's create a new endpoint in our ASP.NET Core application that retrieves the weather for a specific city in a state. This will involve creating a new controller action that accepts parameters for the city and state, and returns weather data.

We'll also want to follow existing coding standards and ensure that the endpoint is tested.

Upon completion of this plan, output the plan in markdown format, including a todo list that outlines the steps to implement the new endpoint. The todo list should be clear and concise, allowing for easy tracking of progress.
